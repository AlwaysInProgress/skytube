# This is Sky Tube

Can you stop a skydiver from hitting the ground with a tube full of fluids of increasing density, thus stopping the skydiver with a combination of drag and buoyancy? Only one way to find out!

You ever been flying around on your private jet and wanted to jump out? Not jump out with one of those pesky sacks on your back but into a giant sky tube! Well lets do the math!

What do we want?

## TODO:

- To show different colors for different densities?
  - Later move to doing particles?
- Have tick marks to show the diver's position
- replace circle with $\pi$
- Jump from animated plane
- Write a latex paper going over things?
- Make a free body diagram of forces
- Acceleration bar: max = death
- Display Velocity and forces
